#PROGRAMMING 

[First Newsletter](First Newsletter)

I've been wanting to write more blog articles mostly for three reasons:
- I believe writing will help clarify my thought's and cement my knowledge.
- I've only ever really taken information from the internet and not contributed to the vast body of knowledge on it. As someone who's mostly an autodidact I'm indebted to the author's of internet content and hope I can produce something that may benefit other's.
- It's a reasonable way for me to document some of the projects and thing's i'm working on.

Now I've tried blogging in the past and it's always felt like such a tedious task. Granted i didn't exert to much of an effort to make it work. I wanted something simple that I had full control over. I went with [AstroJS](https://astro.build/) and markdown, using a CMS like WordPress or Ghost just felt so bloated to me of course this is probably totally unfounded. I wanted to be able to write post's in my text editor and easily move my files around. Well... that didn't last long I pretty quickly realized how much I hated dealing with image's and linking to other pages was such a pain. On top of that squeezing in my desired folder structure in to Astro was really annoying i just wanted my assets collocated and I needed to really jump through hoops to do that. 

I've been using Obsidian for the better part of a year now and i really like it. I'm not a power user by any stretch and my note taking habit's could be way better. Towards the end of 2023 I'd been thinking to myself i ought to give blogging a try again. As one normally does near the turn of the year. Which got me thinking **how could i start blogging again and reduce the pain's from last time?** I knew obsidian publish existed but didn't want to depend on them and a monthly fee for hosting my content (I am a sync user though) so i thought why not just use obsidian as a local first CMS and write a pipeline to move the file's over to my Astro directory.

I thought this might give me my ideal mix of ease of use and customization. Plus how hard could it be i can't imagine this pipeline consists of more than 200 LOC of python.
